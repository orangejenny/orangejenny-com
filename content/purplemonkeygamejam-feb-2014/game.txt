* Premise: run a race, get back home
* World
	* Grid...perhaps large
	* 90 deg
	* Location
		* Coordinate
		* N, S, E, W: defined (as street id) or not
		* Has food or not
	* Home: coordinate
	* Streets
		* Name & likelihood of danger
		* Or calculate danger based on street length?
* Race
	* Route: list of coordinates
	* You're told which direction, and what street you're on
	* Mechanic...
* Recovery
	* Health
		* Decrements every second - maybe not
		* Decrements with every move
		* Determines how much health a move costs
	* Know how far you are from home, & what general direction home is
	* Smell food when within certain distance, weakly or strongly


TODO
	Complications
		Food: mark locations, then notify when close enough to smell (weak/strong), add health if you reach one
