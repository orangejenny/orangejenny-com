			<h3>Content</h3> 
            <p>Content refers to the abstract information contained on the site: in AIR’s case, content primarily consists of reports, products, news items, information about the organization and its employees, and social networking posts. Images and multimedia, such as the interactive testing tools produced by AIR's Educational Assessment division, are also considered content.</p>
            
		<h4>A Section for People</h4>
		<p>We introduced a new “People” section on the site. This derived from our spring research, where participants from multiple stakeholder groups expressed interest in learning more about the individuals working at AIR. The introductory page, “Meet Our People,” highlights three employees at a time, different employees being featured periodically. Visitors can hover over each featured em- 
		ployee to learn a bit about him or her and can read more detailed profiles of these three or can search for other employees using the directory, with the option to filter by focus area and last name.</p>
		
		<p>Employee profile pages include as much or as little information as the system has available. For employees with fully fleshed-out profiles, the page displays photographs, professional interests, thoughts on life at AIR, and a quote that might explain in the employees’ own words why they came to AIR, what their favorite project has been, or anything else that might interest visitors.</p>
		
		<h4>Increased Use of Images</h4>
		<p>We used imagery much more heavily than the current site does. We recommend that AIR aim to have a representative image for every piece of content on the site. These images might be report covers, screenshots of products, or photographs of employees at work or of the individuals they work with. </p>
