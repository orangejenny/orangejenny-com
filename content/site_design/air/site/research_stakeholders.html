			<h3>Stakeholders</h3> 
            <p>Our team identified groups of stakeholders affected by this project, including employees within AIR (e.g., researchers) and external entities (e.g., policy makers) that interface with AIR via its website. 
            </p><p>We first identified these stakeholder groups during our kickoff meeting. Within AIR, it was important to speak with employees at different levels of the organization. Managers discussed AIR with us at a high level, while researchers told us about their daily work and usage of the website. Board members shared their views as individuals affiliated with AIR for many years but not directly employed by the organization. AIR’s communications team shared their insights from managing the website.
            </p><p>Outside of AIR, prospective employees formed the majority of individuals we spoke with, because our client prioritized the website’s value as a recruitment tool. We spoke with Ph.D. and master’s students at three different universities to learn about their job search strategies and priorities. We met with a few former clients and partners, including a former policymaker, to gain their opinions of working with AIR and what role, if any, the website played in their relationships with AIR. Due to recruiting difficulties, we were unable to speak with any journalists and suggest that future research on the website include this group, along with prospective employees who are further along in their careers than recent Ph.D. and master’s graduates. </p>
