Shoppers frequently picked up and handled products, especially when selecting fresh produce.					<p/>					<em>Handheld Artifacts</em><br/>					Many shoppers brought physical shopping lists to the store, whether handwritten or printed out.					<p/>					<em>Planning</em><br/>					Sur La Table and Bed Bath & Beyond both provided plenty of goods to aid in cooking, but neither contained much relating to the needs of a cook hosting a complex meal. Barnes & Noble displayed many recipe books but much less relating to event planning. Event-oriented books typically contained sample menus and sometimes included multiple lists of ingredients for various party sizes, as well as time frames outlining when to begin tasks and food preparation.					<p/>					<em>Recipes</em><br/>					Shoppers browsed through the recipes section while they shopped for food.<br/>					Contextual Recipes: Whole Foods provided lists of recipes next to foods to help shoppers learn about the usages of the ingredients.					<p/>					<em>Design Insights</em><br/>					Recipes need to be usable in the context shopping so people can check ingredients off as they go.<br/>					Side-by-side comparisons are integral to the shopping experience.<br/>					Support distinctions between different types of groceries so that shoppers know what to use.  (fresh vs dried, peak freshness).<br/>					Recipes need to be printable.<br />					Help cooks scale recipes up or down.<br />					Guide users in planning the timing of the many tasks involved in planning a large meal.<br />				</div>			</div>			<div class="push"></div>		</div>				</div>		<div id="footer">			BID S2010, A3.
