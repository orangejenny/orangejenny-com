She has intermediate computer skills, is familiar with office applications, and owns an iPhone.	Her daughter, Kelli, is 				21 and a student at UCSF. Kathy encourages her to come home often and likes to send her home with leftovers so she knows Kelli is eating well at school.				</p>				<div class="bold">Cooking Experience:</div>				<p>				Kathy has intermediate to expert level cooking skills. She has been cooking for 35 years and her kitchen has accumulated plenty of equipment over this time. She uses 				her grandmother's pots and pans, so her cooking utensils are somewhat limited and she doesn't like other people cooking				with them. She hosts Thanksgiving at her house which includes her sister, her sister's two young children: Jason, 8 and Sarah, 5, her in-laws, and Kelli's boyfriend of 3 years, Steve.				</p>			</div>						<div id="description">								<em>Life Goals</em><br/>				Keep her daughter safe and happy<br/> 				Stay connected with her daughter through social gatherings at her home<br/> 				Promote the health of herself and her husband<br/> 				Keep the peace in her marriage<br/><br/> 				<em>Experience Goals</em><br/>				Make great food<br/> 				Finish cooking the meal on time<br/> 				Please her guests<br/> 				Feel confident in her cooking skills<br/> 				Earn praise from the people she cooks for<br/> 				Get her husband to share more of the cooking<br/> 				Keep her niece and nephew happy during family gatherings<br/><br/> 				<em>End Goals</em><br/> 				Find new recipes<br/> 				Find healthier recipes<br/> 				Find recipes that look like they are hard to make, but are actually simple, to impress friends<br/> 				Keep trips to the grocery store fast and efficient<br/> 				During family events, get help cooking from her family<br/>			</div>			<div class="push"></div>		</div>		</div>				<div id="footer">			BID S2010, A3.
