			About

		Soir&#233;e is a cooking-aid developed by 4 students from Carnegie Mellon University for Basic Interaction Design 2010. We were tasked with exploring the issues and design challenges around transactional web sites that drive a benefit through some aspect of personalization (i.e., novice or expert users) and context of use (i.e., private or public context).

		To gain insight into meal preparation and event management, we performed the user research methods of directed storytelling and brick &amp; mortar observations, along with a competitive analysis to solidify our design space. Next we created a mood board for our site and a design language; we also developed two personas (a novice and an expert) and a scenario to help flush out the demo. Finally we created wireframes and this site prototype. Since, the goal of this site is to prototype the design and interactions for a key-path scenario the site is not fully functional.
