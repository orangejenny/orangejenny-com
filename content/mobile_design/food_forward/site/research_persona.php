        <h4>Representing parents of toddlers</h4>
        <a href="images/susan_and_caleb.jpg"><img src="images/susan_and_caleb.jpg" alt="Susan and Caleb" style="border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:8px; float:right;margin-top:-80px;margin-left:15px;margin-right:-20px; margin-bottom:3px;"/></a>
          <p>A persona is a fictional characterization of actual users in the   target demographic of a product. A persona is developed in order to   encompass the needs of a user group and to help the team develop a human   connection with the data.</p>
            <p>After evaluating our research findings, we developed the persona   of Susan. Susan is a 26-year-old financial consultant. She is married   to Anthony, an aspiring writer who also takes care of their two-year-old   son, Caleb, during the day.</p>
            <p>Due to her profession, Susan doesn't get to see her family   nearly as much as she would like. She is less involved in Caleb's daily   activities than Anthony is, leaving her feeling a bit disconnected from   her son. Susan is concerned that Caleb grows up healthy, and she also   wants to keep her and Anthony's health on track.</p>
            <p>Susan cares about her community and the environment, and she   wants to express those values by eating more local, sustainably-grown   food. However, she does not have the time or resources for in-depth   research.</p>
