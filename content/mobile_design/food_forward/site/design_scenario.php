      <h3>Scenario</h3>
      <h4>The application in Susan's life</h4>
          <p>We drafted a scenario to describe how our application fits into Susan's daily life.</p>
          <table cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0">
            <tr>
              <td><img src="images/1-lunch.jpg" style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #cccccc;" /></td>
              <td valign="top">Anthony is feeding Caleb lunch. He offers Caleb broccoli, something he hasn't tried before. Caleb   likes the broccoli. Pleased, Anthony notes this in the application. The application will begin incorporating broccoli into its suggestions.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="images/2-train.jpg" style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #cccccc;" /></td>
              <td valign="top">Later that day, Susan is on   her way home from work, planning to pick up some fresh produce for dinner. She opens the application and notices that Caleb has tried broccoli and liked it. She browses the application's dinner recommendations, watching how they change when she adjusts her settings   to more heavily weight tried-and-true family favorites - it's been a long day for the whole family, and they could use some comfort food.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="images/3-market.jpg" style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #cccccc;" /></td>
              <td valign="top">At the market, Susan notices a stand of leafy vegetables she doesn't recognize. Curious, she photographs the crate. The application identifies the vegetables as kale and displays a list of related recipes. Susan decides to try one of them as a side dish accompanying macaroni and cheese.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="images/4-making-dinner.jpg" style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #cccccc;" /></td>
              <td valign="top">Once at home, Anthony starts the macaroni and cheese while Susan keeps an eye on Caleb and cooks the kale, using the recipe she picked at the market.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="images/5-dinner.jpg" style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #cccccc;" /></td>
              <td valign="top">Susan, Anthony, and Caleb sit down to a balanced meal tailored to their nutritional needs, environmental values, and personal preferences.</td>
