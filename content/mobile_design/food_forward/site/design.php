          <p>Having identified a task with a definite user need, we began deciding   on specific features, drawing and connecting potential pages. We   decided to have the app blend nutritional, environmental, and   communication goals. The major capabilities we selected:</p>
            <li>Rate foods and recipes</li>
            <li>View recent changes by other users in your household</li>
            <li>Identify unknown foods while shopping using phone's camera</li>
            <li>Include information about which foods are in season in the   user's region</li>
            <li>Browse foods and recipes by their environmental impact and   nutritional value</li>
            <li>Customize nutritional recommendations based on users' dietary   restrictions, age, illnesses, etc.</li>
            <li>Include suggestions for purchasing food, such as tips for   determining if a specific type of fruit is ripe</li>
            <li>Find markets in the area and display recommendations</li>
            <li>Maintain shopping list that anyone in the household can update</li>
