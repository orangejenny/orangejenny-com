            <h3>Sustainable, Healthful Food Management</h3>
            <p>With the hustle and bustle of daily life, an increasingly difficult problem for families today is meal planning. Finding foods that are healthy, sustainable, and that fulfill all the likes/dislikes of the household can be frustrating and time-consuming. FoodForward solves this problem by helping users to:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Locate farmer's markets and other sustainable and local food sources</li>
            	<li>Find food that fulfills dietary restrictions such as diabetes and gluten-free</li>
            	<li>Identify unknown foods, empowering the food-shopping experience</li>
            	<li>Foster a sense of connection between family members</li>
            </ul>
            <p>FoodForward includes custom profiles for each family member to specify likes and dislikes, dietary restrictions related to allergies and illness, and general dietary or health goals.</p>
